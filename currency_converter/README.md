Currency Converter Application
Project Overview

This project is a Currency Converter web application built using React, JavaScript, HTML, CSS, and optionally Tailwind CSS for styling. The application allows users to convert amounts between different currencies using real-time exchange rates fetched from a public currency API.

The goal of this project is to simulate a real-world frontend development workflow by integrating external APIs, managing application state, handling user input, and building a responsive and user-friendly interface. It also serves as practical experience in testing, deployment, and UI enhancement.
